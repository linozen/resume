about = "Tech Generalist and budding Psychotherapist with a Master's in International Relations. Also available for freelance work at the intersection of technology and society."

summary = "I think of myself as a generalist rooted in a foundation of political science, philosophy, economics, and now, psychology. I hold a Master's degree in International Relations and my career thus far has spanned roles in open-source software engineering and system administration, academia and think tanks. With several years of experience managing projects and managing technical systems, I'm adept at navigating complex environments and delivering solutions that meet diverse needs. Currently training as a psychotherapist, I am keen on applying a humanist perspective to my technical work, aiming to improve our individual and collective relationships with emerging technologies."
